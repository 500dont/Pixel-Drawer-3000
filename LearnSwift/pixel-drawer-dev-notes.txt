Resizing Options:

1) As resize happens, canvas size increases and current content is preserved
	Implementation:
	- preserve content during resize
	- at end of resize update grid model by adding to the array of values

2) As resize happens, the drawing becomes larger
	Implementation:
	- preserve aspect ratio
	- increase square size?	

UI supporting both:
- Toggle on / off (probably a lock similar to PS) in the bottom right corner
