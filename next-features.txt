Frames:
Need tool window that: 1) shows list of frames
		       2) allows creation of new frame
		       3) toggle ghost image of previous / next frame
Example:

###########
# Toolbar #
###########
frame 1      <— list of frames
frame 2
frame 3
frame 4
[+ frame]    <— creates a new frame with previous image on it
[ghost prev]
[ghost next] <— display ghost image on top of current frame 

Where to start:
1. Create tool bar with “create new frame” button
2. Hook up button - Save current window, make new copy of it (should include undo / redo stack), add frame to list, if other frame is selected in frame tool bar save current one and go to selected one
3. Then figure out how to ghost prev / next
