Pixel Drawer 3000

- colour in squares on a grid
- change the brush size (e.g. 1 = 1 square, 2 = 2x2 square)
- change the background colour
- erase
- clear canvas
- undo / redo by pixel (i.e. 1 = undo the last pixel, 10 = undo the last 10 pixels)
- right click on a previously used 
- select a colour and replace that colour on the grid with the next selected colour
- save and load previous pixel drawer images (PD3 has it's own format: .pd3000)

Know Issues as of April 13/15:

b/0 - to save you must add the extension ".png", also there's something broken in the conversion so most image apps can't open the pictures *but* Preview should work and if you keep the .pd3000 version, PD3 will be able to open + display that and you can take a screenshot
b/1 - sometimes when the application starts up, the "brush colour" will not be associated with the visible colour palette, click on the "brush colour" well, and then pick a colour to refocus it 
b/2 - when you replace colour a colour, undo doesn't work correctly
